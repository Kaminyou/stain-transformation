# Supplementary data for the paper "Deep learning-based transformation of H&E stained tissues into special stains" 

Three sets of data are contained here.

1: The full set of images used for the stain quality assessment study.

2: The full pathologist reports for each of the 58 diagnoses, along with the adjudication report.

3: Sample fields of view from each of the 58 cases used for the diagnostic study. For each case, the histochemical H&E and stain transformed special stains are shown for the same field of view, while the histochemically stained special stains come from the same area of serial tissue sections.
