# Supplementary data for the paper "Deep learning-based transformation of H&E stained tissues into special stains" 

Three sets of data are contained here.

1: The full set of images used for the stain quality assessment study.

2: The full pathologist reports for each of the 58 diagnoses, along with the adjudication report.

3: Sample fields of view from the cases used for the diagnostic study. For each example, the histochemically stained H&E and stain transformed special stains are shown for the same field of view, while the histochemically stained special stains that are shown come from the same biopsy, through serial tissue sections. 

In addition, the stain-to-stain transformation related TensorFlow codes used in the manuscript can be found here.
